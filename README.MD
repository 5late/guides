# Unix/Linux - Tips/Troubles/Guides

**Welcome to the small stash of guides/articles I have put together as I fix broken things I find in Linux/Unix**

---

## Unsolved Issues

- Please create an issue with your bug if it is unsolved as of yet. Do **NOT** create an unfinished guide.

## Contributing

**You can write your own guide too!**

Please read the following *before* creating a guide:

- All files must be in **MARKDOWN** format (``.md``)
- All filenames must be in CAPITAL-KEBAB-CASE ([Definition](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Kebab-case))
- All filenames must (semi) accurately describe the guide (Don't just put - ``FIX-PROBLEM.md``)
- All files must include a ``##Tested on`` section where you put the operating systems/distros you have tested the solution on
- All files must have a ``##Fix`` section with a solution - **IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION - OPEN AN ISSUE**
- All files must be in the ``unix-tips-and-troubles`` folder in the repo (You can copy it to your own folder if you want)
- All files must be signed by the author (Helps know who to go to for issues)
- Code/Commands **MUST** be put in code tags (``)
